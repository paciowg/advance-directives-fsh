I realize that I will not receive life-sustaining treatments including but not limited to breathing machines, blood transfusions, dialysis, heart machines, and IV drugs to keep my heart working. I also realize that medical personnel will not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and they will allow me to die naturally.</i></p><p></p><p>If my response above indicates that I do not want life-sustaining treatments,</p><p>I expressly authorize my attending physician to withhold or withdraw artificial nutrition and hydration and instruct my healthcare agent (or, if I have not designated a healthcare agent, my default surrogate), my family and the doctors and nurses who are taking care of me to respect this request.</p><p></p><p>If I have a severe, irreversible brain injury or illness and canâ€™t dress, feed, or bathe myself, or communicate my medical wishes, but doctors can keep me alive in this condition for a long period of time, <i>I would like for them to keep trying life-sustaining treatments for 2 months.</i></p><p></p><p>Although I understand that, depending on the situation and circumstances, medical personnel may not be able to follow my wishes, here are my general thoughts on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR):</p><p><i>I want my healthcare agent to make the decision, but if my chances are slim to none that I'll leave the hospital, even if they resuscitate me, then I absolutely do not want CPR.</i></p><p></p><h2>Other Instructions</h2><p>If it were possible to choose, here is where I would like to spend my final days:</p><p><i>At home.I would like to receive hospice care at home if possible.</i></p></div>"
