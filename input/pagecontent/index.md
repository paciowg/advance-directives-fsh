### Advance Directive Information
<p>TODO 


Advance directive documents are documents that people have traditionally used to express their medical treatment wishes. Advance directives typically consist of two documents – the “living will,” and the “durable medical power of attorney.” A Living Will documents if a person wants “life-sustaining treatments” or not, (e.g., artificial nutrition or hydration, dialysis or the use of a ventilator to help with breathing) should that person suffer a medical emergency and be unable to communicate with the care team. A person uses a medical power of attorney to appoint one or more people to serve as advocates or “healthcare agents” empowered to make medical treatment decisions on behalf of the person if he or she is incapacitated and cannot communicate with medical providers. The Living Will provides information that helps the healthcare agent make treatment decisions on the person’s behalf.<br/>
Healthcare is evolving towards the use of advance care planning and advance care plans and moving away from legal transactional approaches to advance directives. A Personal Advance Care Plan (PACP) is a standard document used to exchange personal advance care planning information authored by the patient. The advance care plan addresses some unknown future time when certain circumstances might arise. It expresses the patient’s goals, preferences, and priorities for care and treatment under those specific circumstances. The statements made in the advance care plan don’t impact care directly. They inform decision-makers who made want to take the person’s goals, preferences, and priorities into consideration should the need arise to make medical treatment decisions on the person’s behalf.</p>
<p>When a person is about to undergo an operation where they will be sedated, or about to have an inpatient stay, or a stay at a nursing or rehab care facility, care providers may ask a patient to make decisions about medical treatments they do or do not want should a circumstance arise when this choice would need to be taken into consideration. A patient may make these decisions for his or her self, or if the patient cannot make these decisions, the healthcare agent may decide. These medical treatment decisions are made in the present. They are instructions provided by the patient or a surrogate decision-maker. These instructions are closely related to advance directives, in that they say, if x happens, then do y. Or, if x happens, do not do y. For this reason, they are often recorded with a person’s advance directives. However, they are not advance directives because they represent treatment instructions that have, in fact, been given by the patient or their healthcare agent. These instructions are considered obligation or prohibition instructions, provided by the patient or the surrogate decision-maker, for the benefit of care providers. Providers involved in care delivery still need to make a judgement call as to whether or not x is happening before they decide if they should do y or not.<br/>
A portable medical order is a document that tells other healthcare professionals the medical orders for life-sustaining treatment for a patient. Portable medical order documents are authored by physicians, not patients. They do not document goals, preferences and priorities that a patient intends to be used as guidance when making care decisions. They document medical treatment intervention decisions that already have been made and are currently in place to guide care delivery.</p>



### Expected Users
<p>TODO

Systems used to create and update patient-generated advance directive information through a patient-directed process need a way for individuals to communicate information about their advance medical care goals, preferences, and priorities.</p>

<p>Individuals need a way to generate and update information related to their advance directives so that their current wishes can inform provider-generated care plans.</p>

<p>Interoperable exchange of the advance directive information supports more effective sharing of advance directive information across transitions in care and enables practitioners to create person-centered care plans that align with a patient’s values, goals of care, treatment preferences, and quality of life priorities when a patient cannot communicate for themselves.</p>

### Background
<p>
The PACIO Project is a collaborative effort to advance interoperable health data exchange between post-acute care (PAC) and other providers, patients, and key stakeholders across health care and to promote health data exchange in collaboration with policy makers, standards organizations, and industry through a consensus-based approach.</p>

<p>The primary goal of the PACIO Project is to establish a framework for the development of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) technical implementation guides and reference implementations that will facilitate health data exchange through standards-based use case-driven application programming interfaces (APIs).
</p>

### Content and Organization
<p>The implementation guide is organized into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="advance_directive_use_case.html">Use Case Example</a> Describes an example of its use and provides a high-level overview of expected process flow.</li>
  <li><a href="underlying_technologies.html">Underlying Technologies</a> Describes the different specifications this implementation guide relies on and indicates what developers should read and understand prior to implementing this specification.</li>
  <li><a href="profile_highlights_and_guidance.html">Profile Highlights and Guidance</a> Provides a closer look at the IG profiles and guidance for constructing profile instances with examples for data exchange.</li>
  <li><a href="security_and_data_sharing.html">Security and Data Sharing</a> Covers issues concerning security and patient information access and sharing.</li>
  <li><a href="artifacts.html">Artifacts Summary</a> Introduces and provides links to the Capability Statement, IG Resource Profiles, and IG Extension Definitions as well as example profile instances.</li>
</ul>

### Dependencies
<p>This implementation guide relies on the following other specifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/">FHIR R4</a> - The ‘current’ official version of FHIR as of the time this implementation guide was published.  See the <a href="underlying_technologies.html">background page</a> for key pieces of this specification implementers should be familiar with.</li>
