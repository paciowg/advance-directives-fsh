<p> </p>
<p><b>In case Iâ€™m being cared for by a person(s) who doesn't know me very well, Iâ€™d like my following thoughts to be known.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>My likes / joys:</b></p>
<p>Here are some examples of the things that I would like to have near me, music that Iâ€™d like to hear, and other details of my care that would help to keep me happy and relaxed:</p>
<p><i>I love the smell of lavender and the feeling of sunshine on my face.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>My dislikes / fears:</b></p>
<p>Here is a list of things that I would like to avoid if at all possible, people that I donâ€™t wish to see, and concerns I have about particular family members, pets, and so on:</p>
<p><i>I do not like my feet to be cold.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>How to care for me:</b></p>
<p>If I become incapacitated and cannot express myself, here is what I would like to tell my healthcare agent, family and friends about how I would like for them to care for me:</p>
<p><i>I want photos of my family where I can see them.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>My religion:</b></p>
<p>If I appear to be approaching the end of my life, here are some things that I would like for my caregivers to know about my faith and my religion.</p>
<p><i>Please call Father Mark if my condition warrants the services of a priest.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Please attempt to notify someone from my religion at the following phone number:</b></p>
<p>If I have included one</p>
<p><i>Catholic</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>My unfinished business:</b></p>
<p>If it appears that I am approaching the end of my life, and I cannot communicate with persons around me, I would want my doctors and nurses, my family, and my friends to know about some unfinished business that I need to address:</p>
<p><i>I want my sister and I to talk again, and miss her.  I wish we hadn't disagreed all those years ago and regret the time it has cost us.  I'd like to see her face if I were very ill and needed the comfort of family at my side.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Laughter:</b></p>
<p>These are some of my fondest memories from life that have always brought a smile to my face or made me laugh:</p>
<p><i>My dogs make me laugh when they play together, and my grandchildren make me laugh when they put on plays for me.  They bring me great joy.</i></p>

<p><b>My Advance Care Goals</b></p>
<p>If I am so sick or seriously injured that I cannot express my own medical treatment preferences, and if I am not expected to live without additional treatment for my illness, disease, condition or injury, then I want my medical care team to know that these are the things that are most important to me:</p>
<ol>
	<li><i>Avoiding prolonged dependence on machines</i></li>
	<li><i>Not being a physical burden to my family</i></li>
	<li><i>Dying at home</i></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>Here are some thoughts that I would like for my medical care team and my healthcare agent(s) to know about the role that religion, faith or spirituality play in my life:</p>
<p><i>I am Catholic, please call Father Mark at Saint Catherine's on Main Street.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I am having significant pain or suffering,</p>
<p><i>I would like my doctors to consult a Supportive and Palliative Care Team to help treat my physical, emotional and spiritual discomfort, and to support my family.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>My Preferences in Specific Circumstances</b></p>
<p>In addition to the general advance care goals provided above, below are specific treatment preferences with respect to certain specific circumstances or situations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If my health ever deteriorates due to a terminal illness, and my doctors believe I will not be able to interact meaningfully with my family, friends, or surroundings,</p>
<p><i>I would like for them to keep trying life-sustaining treatments until my healthcare agent decides it is time to stop and such treatments and let me die gently.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I have a severe, irreversible brain injury or illness and canâ€™t dress, feed, or bathe myself, or communicate my medical wishes, but doctors can keep me alive in this condition for a long period of time,</p>
<p><i>I would like for them to keep trying life-sustaining treatments until my healthcare agent decides it is time to stop and such treatments and let me die gently.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although I understand that, depending on the situation and circumstances, medical personnel may not be able to follow my wishes, here are my general thoughts on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR):</p>
<p><i>I want my healthcare agent to decide for me.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Other Instructions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If it were possible to choose, here is where I would like to spend my final days:</p>
<p><i>At home.I would like to receive hospice care at home if possible.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I understand that, in certain jurisdictions, if I have been diagnosed as pregnant and that diagnosis is known to my attending physician, medical treatment providers may refuse to follow my directives and provide life-sustaining treatment including artificially administered nutrition and hydration, as well as CPR and other resuscitation measures.</p>
